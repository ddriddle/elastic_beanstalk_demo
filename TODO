Need to figure out layout / buckets
  * Document this
  * Think about it...
* What perms do we need / want on ECR?
* Think about renaming Drone bucket. It is the input for CodePipeline...
* How do we apply a "version label" to a source bundle?
* Dockerrun.aws.json needs to be a template! Pin each version to a paticular Docker image!
* Add outputs to EB module!
